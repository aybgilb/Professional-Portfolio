I led the end-to-end development and deployment of an app-enabled project inspired by a fitness app, designed to enhance user experiences and operational efficiency. The app features a real-time temperature sensor integrated using SensorManager, 
allowing users to monitor, edit, and set thresholds for temperature data. It includes a customizable SMS alert system that sends notifications only when thresholds are exceeded, ensuring practicality and reducing unnecessary interruptions. 
The user-centered interface prioritizes simplicity and visual feedback, displaying temperature data prominently and ensuring seamless interaction without intrusive alerts.

To maintain organization and scalability, I adopted a modular development approach, separating classes for tasks like handling temperature data, sending SMS alerts, and managing the UI. The successful integration of SQL enabled efficient storage and 
retrieval of user data, while SensorManager ensured accurate real-time data processing. The app was rigorously tested on an Android emulator, allowing for the identification and resolution of issues prior to deployment. This comprehensive approach 
resulted in a reliable, user-friendly application that effectively balances functionality and usability.
