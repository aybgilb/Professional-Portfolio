The client was The Gaming Room, and my task was to create a web-based game where players compete to guess the drawing being described from a stock library. Since the client lacked technical expertise in creating the environment, my role involved streamlining development and addressing their requirements effectively, with a strong focus on leveraging AI and cloud services like AWS.
While developing the documentation, I integrated my expertise in UI/UX design and software engineering to provide actionable recommendations suitable for a web-based application enhanced by AI. This included identifying tools and frameworks that could support AI-driven features such as real-time image recognition and natural language processing. I also outlined AWS solutions like S3 for scalable storage and Lambda for serverless architecture, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and efficient performance across multiple systems.
A key process in the design phase was defining and finalizing the UML diagrams. Completing the UML served as a blueprint for structuring the code, particularly for integrating AI algorithms and cloud services. It also clarified the data flow, making it easier to connect AI components and AWS functionalities, such as deploying trained models to AWS SageMaker and handling requests efficiently through API Gateway.
If I could revise one part of the documentation, it would be the recommendations section. With my current knowledge of AI integration and AWS, I could make more robust recommendations tailored to the project's scalability and performance needs. For instance, incorporating AWS SageMaker for training and deploying AI models, or using AWS DynamoDB for real-time data storage, would enhance the game's responsiveness and provide a seamless experience for users.
I interpreted the users' needs by identifying their pain points and aligning them with technological solutions. For instance, the game involves guessing images from a stock library, so I knew memory, storage, and AI-powered search would be critical. Additionally, as a cross-platform game, ensuring robust network connectivity and security was paramount. Leveraging AWS services like RDS for scalable databases and IAM for enhanced security ensured that these aspects were addressed comprehensively. Considering user needs is vital because it ensures the application not only solves problems but also delivers an efficient, seamless experience by integrating AI and cloud-based solutions.
The UML diagrams were instrumental in guiding the design process, particularly for implementing AI and cloud features. As a gamer myself, I kept the end user in perspective, ensuring the design addressed key needs. For example, implementing AI for dynamic image recognition ensured players could interact with a more intelligent and responsive system. Security was another critical focus; AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) helped secure the application. Additionally, I recommended using AWS Elastic Load Balancing to ensure that images and game data were served efficiently without overloading the system. These cloud-based solutions, combined with the design document and coding, allowed me to make impactful recommendations for a secure, high-performing application.
